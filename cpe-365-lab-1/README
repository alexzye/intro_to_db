Instructions:

Our implentation language was Python 2. Our main
program can be run with the following command:

        "python schoolsearch.py"

You will be prompted with usage instructions on
run.

For analytics functionality, use the 'An[alytics]' command. 
For example, when prompted, the command:

        "An G"

provides analytic information based on grade level of the student.

Another example, the command:

        "An T"

provides analytics for the teacher teaching the student.

Our write-up is found in CPE365Lab1_2WriteUp.pdf and
a sample output from a run can be found in
